This repo contains the code for my personal website, which can be found at [philswatton.github.io](https://philswatton.github.io).

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You'll need to install this first along with its pre-requisites to host the website on your own machine. You can find the installation instructions [at this link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once installed, you can host a local version of the website by running
```
$ jekyll serve
```
in your command line. Note that you will need to have set the working directory to the location of these files.
