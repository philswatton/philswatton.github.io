# Research
<p class="update-notice"><em>Last updated 25/11/2024</em></p>

I'm lucky enough to do research for a living, previously as a PhD student and now as a Data Scientist. This page lists my publications, with work conducted across the fields of political science, data science, and artificial intelligence. I do my best to keep this page up to date, but for a list that's more likely (though not guaranteed) to be current I recommend visiting my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=mbxIgHAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

## PhD Thesis

My PhD thesis is titled <strong>Three Essays on the Measurement of Political Ideology</strong>. It has three component papers:

1. Agree to Agree: Correcting Acquiescence Bias in the Case of Fully Unbalanced Scales with Application to UK Measurements of Political Beliefs
2. Age Isn't Just a Number:  A Comparative Age-Period-Cohort Analysis of Political Beliefs in Europe
3. Social Democratic Party Positions on the EU: The Case of Brexit
